    <h1>Emoji Spelling Bee™</h1>

    <br>

    <p>Welcome to the Emoji Spelling Bee™! This is a fun and interactive game where you can test your spelling skills using emojis. The game presents you with a series of emojis, and your task is to spell out the word that they represent. It's a great way to learn new words and have fun at the same time!</p>

    <br>

    <p>It combines the joy of spelling games and the fun of emojis into a game that is way more fun then math. </p>

        About the Creator
    </h3>
    
    <br><br>

    <p>
        The developer of Emoji Spelling Bee is S Hampton. 
        Currently working on an associate’s degree in ‘Computer Programming & Development’.
        Enjoys crafting, reading, and playing video games. A large number of unfinished projects haunt her.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Currently a beginner programmer in HTML, PYTHON, JAVA, and CSS.

    <h3>
        Roadmap
    </h3>

    <br>

    <p>
        Currently Emoji Spelling Bee is only available as a download in .py format. 
        It will only work correctly if you have the correct libraries installed which is a little cumbersome for the average user to install and then utilize. 
        <br><br>
        We would like to see this instead deployed as web-based game. 
        <br><br>
        This would require a little bit more development and refinement for a back-end python and some sort of front-end html. This will require work. 
        <br><br>
        Currently finished deployment is set to Early Fall in 2025!
        <br><br>
        Check back for more updates!
