    <h1>Emoji Spelling Bee™</h1>

    <br>

    <p>It combines the joy of spelling games and the fun of emojis into a game that is way more fun then math. </p>

    <h3>
        The 'Emoji Spelling Bee™' is a project by S.H.

                The premise of the game is the game will generate a random emoji and you will have to spell it correctly. If you get too many incorrect answers, it will be game over! There are two differing modes you can play with three levels of difficulty.

        <tr>
            <td style="width: 20%;">Standard</td>
            <td>
                Spell the words the emojis represent. No spaces, all lower-case. You will have a set number of hints, depending on your selected difficulty. Once your hints are exhausted, your lives will be deducted until they reach zero. At that point it will be game over. 💀

        <tr>
            <td style="width: 20%;">Trial</td>
            <td>
                Spell the words the emoji's represent. No spaces, all lower-case. There will be eight emoji's on your spelling test. You will have 3 hints. The final emoji must be solved without ANY help. Can you win the spelling bee? 🐝
